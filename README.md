These two modules install and configure Google Chrome
These are designed and tested with Windows ten as a slave while ubuntu 16.04 is the master. These modules must be ran twice for it to work as I want. Which means it adds 5 pages to bookmarks and makes my homepage chromes homepage and on the 1st opening of Google Chrome it opens extension page where you can add uBlock extension to your browser.

NOTE
These modules also need chocolatey module from puppet forge.
